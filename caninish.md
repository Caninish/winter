# DIY Tablet

## Summary

It's a tablet. It'll do all the functions of a regular computer/tablet but without a camera. This will be my first electronic project ever, and it mostly requires 3d-printing knowledge and understanding how connecting this and that works. I also really want a tablet for sketching, so this will be perfect.

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

## Plan

First, purchase the supplies. Obviously.
Second, the case. I need to make sure I can get everything to fit in a small and thick case behind the screen. I'll also need to figure out where to cut holes and how to puzzle piece everything. Oh, and the case color, which would probably be black but could be something else. Then, 3d print the case and make sure everything fits. I'll extend the right side of the case to become a penholder (doubles as a hand rest?) and on the bottom right a undo button.
Third, connect the battery to the motherboard along with the on/off button/switch thingy. Connect the motherboard to the screen. Basically, connect everything. Probably need some wires.
Fourth, use the sd card to download os.
Fifth, fit everything in the case, get a stylus and (download the software for drawing first lol) draw. Yay.

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget
